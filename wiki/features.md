## New Ideas
### Member Management
- Add members to tenants and to specific courses.
- Once a member is added to a tenant and given access to a course, the member should see videos in that course.

### Permission Control
- Allow the admin (tenant creator) to delete videos from a course; restrict this permission to the admin only.
